# Train-the-Trainer: Dakshina Chitra — Session I
Train-the-Trainer module for guides-to-be: "What a Guide Is | Added Value vs Audioguide | Audience Adaptation" 
Author: Gallien Figuereo — Date: August 2025

## What this repo contains
- Full Trainer Deck (25 slides)  
- Trainee Handout (1 page)
- Facilitator Guide with Timings and Prompt (2 pages) 
- Pre/Post-quiz to assess Trainee understanding (1 page)
- Feedback quiz to assess Trainer (1 page)

## Context
The Dakshina Chitra Heritage Museum is an Open-air museum in Chennai in South-eastern India presenting a unique collection of traditional village houses from all over South India (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, 
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka). 
It preserves, promotes, and presents key aspects of South Indian cultures that are not widely known to the general public and are at risk of being forgotten.
The museum is currently working towards creating Audioguides and starting Guided tours to enhance visitor experience and understanding of those cultures. In April 2025 I had the opportunity to help a bit in 
the verification of the audioguide script

## Approach
- Methodology: **ADDIE** (Analyze → Design → Develop → Implement → Evaluate)  
- Learning objectives: explain role & limits; articulate human guide added value; identify audience types  
- Deliverables: slide deck, facilitator guide, one-page handout, quizzes
  
## ADDIE mapping
- Analyze: Needs: The museum does not have Guides currently, they need to be Trained
- Design: SMART objectives — Explain Guide role and their relevance through a 60-minutes workshop
- Develop: Created trainer deck, participant slides, facilitator guide, trainee handout, pre/post quiz and feedback quiz
- Implement: Materials are ready-to-run with timing & prompts for the 60 minutes session for repeatability
- Evaluate: Evaluation uses pre/post quiz and participant feedback (Kirkpatrick Level 1 & 2)

## Needs Analysis
The Dakshina Chitra Museum does not have Guides currently. The Guides-to-be need to be Trained and this first session is part of a series to Train them regarding what is expected of them: What it means to be a
Guide, Why a Guide is useful (especially compared to the Audioguide being created for the museum) and the importance of Adapting to the Group you are Guiding.
This module addresses those gaps with a short train-the-trainer session

## Design and Implementation

This module was intentionally designed using **Gagné’s Nine Events**. Below is how each event maps to the session deliverables and evaluation:

1. Gain attention  
- Implementation: Slide 1 intro + 30s ice-breaker (“What makes a great guide?”) 
- Evidence: slide 1, Dakshina Chitra Facilitator Guide - Final.pdf

2. Inform learners of objectives
- Implementation: Slide 3 lists objectives clearly 
- Evidence: slide 3, Dakshina Chitra Training Powerpoint.pdf

3. Stimulate recall of prior learning
- Implementation: Pre-quiz and a warm-up discussion to surface prior assumptions; repetition of core points during session.  
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Pre-Post Quiz - Final.pdf

4. Present the content 
- Implementation: Structured trainer deck (Slides 5–21) which progresses from definitions to added-value to personas  
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Training Powerpoint.pdf

5. Provide learning guidance
- Implementation: Clear dos/don’ts and a 1-page trainee handout for on-the-job assitance  
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Facilitator Guide - Final.pdf

6. Elicit performance
- Implementation: Pair practice rounds (60s openings) and group activities converting audioguide text into human-value descriptions.  
- Evidence: slide activity prompts; observer rubric.

7. Provide feedback  
- Implementation: Immediate formative feedback after practice and written feedback via the feedback form.  
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Pre-Post Quiz - Final.pdf + Dakshina Chitra Facilitator Guide - Final.pdf

8. Assess performance  
- Implementation: Pre/post quiz to measure knowledge & confidence and Feedback quiz for reaction (Kirkpatrick L1–L2).  
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Pre-Post Quiz - Final.pdf + Dakshina Chitra Feedback Quiz - Final.pdf

9. Enhance retention & transfer  
- Implementation: 1-page handout for on-the-job use and recommended follow-up practice
- Evidence: Dakshina Chitra Trainees Handout - Final.pdf

## How to use
1. Download the trainer deck and facilitator guide.  
2. Print the trainee handout (1 per participant).
3. Run the 60-minute session as timed in the guide.  
4. Collect pre/post quizzes and feedback; update files iteratively.
