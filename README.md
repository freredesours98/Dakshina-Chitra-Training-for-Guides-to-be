## Context
The Dakshina Chitra Heritage Museum is an Open-air museum in Chennai in South-eastern India presenting a unique collection of traditional village houses from all over South India (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, 
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka). 
It preserves, promotes, and presents key aspects of South Indian cultures that are not widely known to the general public and are at risk of being forgotten.
The museum is currently working towards creating Audioguides and starting Guided tours to enhance visitor experience and understanding of those cultures. In April 2025 I had the opportunity to help a bit in 
the verification of the audioguide script

## Approach (Design & Develop)
- Methodology: **ADDIE** (Analyze → Design → Develop → Implement → Evaluate)  
- Learning objectives: explain role & limits; articulate human guide added value; identify audience types  
- Deliverables: slide deck, facilitator guide, one-page handout, quizzes
- 
## ADDIE mapping
- Analyze: Needs: The museum does not have Guides currently, they need to be Trained
- Design: SMART objectives — Explain Guide role and their relevance through a 60-minutes workshop
- Develop: Created trainer deck, participant slides, facilitator guide, trainee handout, pre/post quiz and feedback quiz
- Implement: Materials are ready-to-run with timing & prompts for the 60 minutes session for repeatability
- Evaluate: Evaluation uses pre/post quiz and participant feedback (Kirkpatrick Level 1 & 2)

## Problem / Need (Analyze)
The Dakshina Chitra Museum does not have Guides currently. The Guides-to-be need to be Trained and this first session is part of a series to Train them regarding what is expected of them: What it means to be a
Guide, Why a Guide is useful (especially compared to the Audioguide being created for the museum) and the importance of Adapting to the Group you are Guiding.
This module addresses those gaps with a short train-the-trainer session.

## How to use
1. Download the trainer deck and facilitator guide.  
2. Print the trainee handout (1 per participant).
3. Run the 60-minute session as timed in the guide.  
4. Collect pre/post quizzes and feedback; update files iteratively.
